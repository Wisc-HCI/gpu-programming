      Use the chatbox below to create a story about the Misty robot! 
      Add characters to the story, describe where it takes place, and what happens in it. 
      Use the Milestones panel on the right to figure out what to add to the story.
      Use the Robot Features panel in the bottom right to understand what the Misty robot is capable of doing.
      Your story should consist of actions Misty can actually perform.
      If you get stuck at any point, you can click the "Help Me" button(s) in the Milestones panel on the right.

      Most importantly, have fun!
